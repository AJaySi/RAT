The performance, stress and load capabilities of this tool comes from k6 javascript tool.
This is test functional performance tests as part of the unit testing. 

This is meant for unit performance testing for AE APIs.
TBD: Specialized REST API performance tools like jmeter, gatling, tsung or locust should be evaluated.

k6 supports all standard HTTP verbs/methods:
CONNECT, DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT and TRACE.

#----------------------------------------------------
Present limitation/TBDs:

1). There is a file mapping for each rest method. 
There are 6 js files which can put in a single js file for easier manitenance.

2). Many of k6 capabilities are not captured or exported by our testframework.
As the acceptability of this tool grows, we will need add relative k6 features into this tool.
